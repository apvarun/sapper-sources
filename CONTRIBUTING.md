# Contributing Guide

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## How to contribute

- Fork the project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR)
  - Explain what the PR fixes or improves
  - Screenshots for bonus points
  - Update the Readme if and when required
- Use sensible commit messages
  - If your PR fixes a separate issue number, include it in the commit message
- Use a sensible number of commit messages as well
  - e.g. Your PR should not have 100s of commits

## Commit messages

- Squashing to 1 commit is **not** required at this time
- Use sensible commit messages (when in doubt: `git log`)
- Use a sensible number of commit messages
- If your PR fixes a specific issue number, include it in the commit message: `"Fixes XYZ error (fixes #123)"`
